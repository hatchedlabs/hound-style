# hound-style
hound code lint &amp; style global config (pulled in by all repos)


see this: https://github.com/thoughtbot/guides/tree/master/style

once the config above is setup, then we need to go flip this switch in hound:
https://robots.thoughtbot.com/hound-introduces-style-guides-for-organisations

then update this readme file to make more meaninful sense :)
